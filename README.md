# Personal Library Manager:

A simple and elegant Personal Library Manager built with Streamlit.

A Personal Library Manager is a software application that helps you organize, track, and manage your personal collection of books.

Instead of keeping a notebook or trying to remember which books you have, this tool gives you a digital way to manage your library. You can:

➕ Add books with details like title, author, genre, and publication year

📝 Edit or update book info (like if you've finished reading it)

❌ Delete books you no longer have

🔍 Search for books by title or author

📊 Track which books you've read, are reading, or want to read
